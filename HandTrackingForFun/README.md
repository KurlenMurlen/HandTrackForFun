[You are free to use this code however you wish]
This code was made solely for fun, it was made during my class break and I have no ideas for
real world application.
It was developed using the following libraries:
    cv2
    mediapipe as mp
    time
    math
    pyautogui
    numpy
It does of course also need a camera to work, in the code specifically it uses my integrated webcam, which sucks, but was just about enough.
This was inspired after I booked a test session to use the Apple Vision.
I do accept suggestions for better calibration of the hand movements.
